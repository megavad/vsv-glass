    <p>This application is for scanning glass for white rounds 20mm+ in diameter, which represents small (&lt;1mm in diameter) defects detected by precise laser measurement system during float process and marked with color.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continuous float glass ribbon from furnace dividing into rectangles with special size to minimize waste in next cutting operations (in accordance with planned model of the car), and we are detecting white rounds on that rectangles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These rectangles dividing into another smaller quadrangles, some of them could contain white rounds(as described above) and should not be processed but scrapped.

</ul>

<p class="note info">Rectangle with affected quadrangle: defect is represented by rectangle because of detection procedure, its resolution is 10mm, so we need to extend defected area to exclude error (Ex.: when front edge of round could be between IR detectors).</p>

<h2 id="economics">Economics</h2>

<p>This glass is cheaper, automation of scrapping and processing time saving is reasonable</p>
